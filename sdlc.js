// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const analysisofrequirements = "In this second step, the tasks are to deine the application, document the project requirements, and seek stakeholder approval. During this phase it is also important to take note of application features, potential roadblocks, and resources required."
const design = "This third step models how the application will work as well as aspects of the design. Aspects may include: how customers will interact with the software (UI), the programming languages used, security, communication systems, architecture, platforms used."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step where the program is written out. This can be done by a single develper or by a large team dedicated to differnt roles in the development."
const testingandintegration = "In this fifth step, continuous testing is done to ensure that each piece of the program runs cohesively together. This reduces the number of issues and 'bugs' that users may encounter when using the application."
const maintain = "This final and sixth step is to then monitor the various elements of the software. These can include system performance, user experience, and security. During this step, bugs are discovered that were missed during testing. In this step, developers will analyze and then aim to resolve the bugs and errors in the system. "
